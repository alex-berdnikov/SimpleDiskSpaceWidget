This widget basically shows you a simple graphic representation of used space on the available storages on your device and text hints with a detailed information about used space. To use it simply add it to your home screen using widget menu. Keep in mind that this widget doesn't have any screens associated with it that you could launch from the launcher.

Widget updates its information approximately every minute and several times per minute if the device is connected to the computer or charger.
